# Credit Card Fraud Detection ML Model
Credit card fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning (ML) that aims to identify fraudulent transactions and minimize financial losses for banks, merchants, and customers. Given the rapid growth of e-commerce and digital transactions, the development of effective fraud detection models has become increasingly important.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
## Project Workflow
1.	Collecting Data from Kaggle
2.	Data Preprocessing and normalizing the transaction data, handling class imbalance issues.
3.	Statistical Data Analysis with the clean data
4.	Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
5.	Training a classification algorithm using logistic regression to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
6.	Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like over sampling or under sampling for improving results.
7.	Cross validation Checking with the Random Forest Classification Algorithm.

## Accuracy of the Model
1.	Cross Validation Accuracy Using Logistic Regression:  92.98 %
2.	Cross Validation Accuracy Using Random Forest:  93.49 %
